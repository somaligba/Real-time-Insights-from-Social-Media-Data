# Real-Time Insights from Twitter

## Project Overview

This project aims to gather and analyze real-time data from Twitter to provide insights into current trends and topics. The analysis includes data collection, processing, and visualization of key metrics, such as sentiment analysis, hashtag usage, and tweet frequency.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Stream and collect tweets using the Twitter API.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of tweets to determine public opinion.
- **Hashtag Analysis**: Identify trending hashtags and topics.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key metrics and trends in real-time.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: The notebook is compatible with Python 3.x.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Required for running and viewing the `.ipynb` file.
- **Twitter Developer Account**: Access to the Twitter API requires a developer account and API keys.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
